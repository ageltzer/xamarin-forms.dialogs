# A Beginners Guide To Dialogs In Xamarin.Forms
An introduction to the various dialogs that we can use in a Xamarin.Forms app.

## Introduction

When developing mobile applications, dialogs are a foundational building block in our tool-belt. We can use dialogs to show a confirmation message, to indicate when the app is working or even to create a rich input form that appears over our main user interface.

This article aims to be a getting-started guide for using dialogs in Xamarin.Forms and is intended to be a beginners guide. I aim to introduce the core concepts and terminology, get you started with the most current dialog frameworks and provide a quick reference on the main dialog types. 

If you're totally new Xamarin.Forms and want to learn about dialogs, this is the article for you ðŸ˜‰

Before we dive in, let's take a moment to introduce two important terms used throughout this article:

 * **Modal**: A dialog appears over the existing user interfaes and blocks input to the elements beneath it, not allowing them to exit by tapping outside it.. Modal dialogs effectively "focus" the users attention onto the dialog
 * **Transient**: A temporary dialog and dismisses by itself without user intervention. For example, dialogs that automatically dismiss after a specified time span are transient.

These terms, Modal and Transient, will be used many times in this article

Next, let's explore the six main dialogs kinds that we will explore in this guide:

 * [Alerts](#alerts): A dialog that shows a message.
 * [Prompts](#prompts): A dialog that requests input from a user.
 * [Action Sheets](#action-sheets): A list of choices presented to a user.
 * [Toast](#toasts): A small, unobtrusive message that shows for a small amount of time.
 * [Activity Indicator](#activity-indicators): A dialog to indicate that our app is working.
 * [Custom Popups](#custom-Popups): A modal dialog with fully customised content.

## Dialogs 101

### Alerts

An **Alert** is a modal dialog used to show a message to a user.

Alerts are a convenient way to inform

Using Acr.UserDialogs, we would show an alert like so:

```
Acr.UserDialogs.UserDialogs.Instance.Alert("Welcome to aler", "Ok");
```

Some common use cases

A special kind of alert dialog is a **Confirm** dialog, an alert that display a message with a choice of two or more actions.

### Toasts

A **Toast** is a small, temporary popup that shows at the bottom of the screen useful for display displaying small and unobtrusive messages. Toasts are effectively transient dialogs
